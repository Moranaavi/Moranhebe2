<h4> What is Quality Assurance to me?</h4>
<p> <br>  The field of software QA has always intrigued me.<br> The ability to investigate product quality and suggest improvements that will get better performance.
    <br> I have critical thinking and the ability to go into detail.<br> I would like to learn new things, always keep up to date with innovations in order to improve my analysis ability and achieve better results.
    <br> From my point of view, the right strategy to perform quality tests and achieve good results is:<br> 
    <br> Planning <br>  Time management <br>  Work by priorities
</p>
<p> <i>"The task of engineering is to make it work once,<br> while the task of Quality Assurance is to make it work all the time."</p></i>

  <p> I am 37 years old and living in Rosh HaAyin. <br> I am happily married and a mother of 3 lovely children. <br>
     In my belief :<i> "If you don't like something,<b> change it.</b><br>If you can't change it, <b>change the way </b>you think about it. </i>
  <br> And that's what keeps me creative in problem-solving.
